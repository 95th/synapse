                                  Synapse RPC v0.1

Protocol assumptions: message based, full duplex, persistent connections, SSL
optional (i.e. websockets). Websocket text frames with JSON encoding are used
currently by the server. This is subject to change.

                                 AUTHENTICATION

By default synapse will bind its RPC port to localhost; in this mode, authentication
is not required. However, if synapse is configured to bind to 0.0.0.0, it will require
authentication to be used to connect. Authentication is performed using the url
query parameter password on upgrade.

                                    DATETIME

Datetimes are encoded in RFC 3339 and ISO 8601, in UTC.

                                   RESOURCES

The server exposes resources and updates to those resources to the client. A
resource might be a torrent, tracker, peer, etc, as indicated by the type
field, and the server assigns a ID to each resource. IDs are deterministic
and can be expected to be consistent across sessions and for the same resource
(i.e. the same given torrent will have the same ID on several different
machines). Fields marked with * are mutable via UPDATE_RESOURCE messages.

                               CRITERION OBJECTS

Criteria is supported in some places to do server-side filtering of resources.
A criterion can be specified like so:

    {
        "field": string,            Field to filter for
        "op": operation enum,
        "value": *,                 Value to test against
    }

Operation enum:
    "==": equal to
    "!=": not equal to
    ">": greater than
    ">=": greater than or equal to
    "<": less than
    "<=": less than or equal to
    "like": value is a LIKE test with SQL syntax
    "ilike": value is an ILIKE test with SQL syntax
    "in": value is an array of values for equality test
    "!in": value is an array of values for non-equality test

                                    MESSAGES

A message sent from either the client->server or server->client will take this
format:

    {
        "type": string,
        "serial": number,
        .
        .
        .
    }

The type field is a unique identifier for the message type, and defines the
schema of the remaining fields. The serial is a number allocated by the client
that increments for each message, but may be omitted from server messages. The
server may include a serial in its messages to indicate which message from the
client it pertains to.

                               RESOURCE MESSAGES

If you know a resource ID is extant, you can query the server for information
about it with these messages.

GET_RESOURCES           client->server

Fetches a resource or resources by ID. The server responds with RESOURCES
messages.

    {
        "type": "GET_RESOURCES",
        "ids": [
            IDs,
            .
            .
            .
        ]
    }

SUBSCRIBE               client->server

Subscribes to changes on a resource or resources. The server will respond with
RESOURCES message(s) to populate the initial set of resources, and will
periodically send additional RESOURCES message(s) to update the client as the
state of these resources changes.

    {
        "type": "SUBSCRIBE",
        "ids": [
            IDs,
            .
            .
            .
        ]
    }

UNSUBSCRIBE             client->server

Used by the client to indicate it no longer wants updates for these resources.

    {
        "type": "UNSUBSCRIBE",
        "ids": [
            IDs,
            .
            .
            .
        ]
    }

UPDATE_RESOURCES        server->client

Indicates that the client should update its internal representation of some
resources. Note that the only constraint on the resource type is that
an id field, type field, and at least one other data field be present.
When a client sends a SUBSCRIBE message, the first UPDATE_RESOURCES
response will always contain the complete representation of the subscribed
resources. Following this partial updates will be sent.

    {
        "type": "UPDATE_RESOURCES",
        "resources": [
            { ...resource type...  },
            .
            .
            .
        ]
    }

FILTER_SUBSCRIBE        client->server

Indicates that the client would like to receive updates for all new resources
matching a given criteria. The server will send RESOURCES_EXTANT messages for
any resources that already match, as well as RESOURCES_EXTANT for any resources
that match this criteria in the future and RESOURCES_REMOVED for matching
resources that are made invalid.

    {
        "type": "FILTER_SUBSCRIBE",
        "kind": string,            The kind of resource to filter for, defaults to "torrent"
        "criteria": [
            { ...criterion object... },
            .
            .
            .
        ]
    }

Because the default kind of criterion is "torrent", a client can receive the
list of valid torrent IDs and subscribe to new/removed torrents by sending
FILTER_SUBSCRIBE upfront. The "order" field will be used for the initial set of
RESOURCES_EXTANT, but will be disregarded for future updates.

FILTER_UNSUBSCRIBE      client->server

Indicates that the client would no longer like to be subscribed to a filter.

    {
        "type": "FILTER_UNSUBSCRIBE",
        "filter_serial": number,
    }

"filter_serial" should be set to the serial of the FILTER_SUBSCRIBE message the
client wishes to cease its subscription for. Upon unsubscribing, all resource
IDs associated with this filter (and no other active filters) become invalid.

RESOURCES_EXTANT        server->client

Sent by the server to indicate that new resources are available.

    {
        "type": "RESOURCES_EXTANT",
        "serial": number,           the serial of the relevant client message
        "ids": [
            IDs,
            .
            .
            .
        ]
    }

RESOURCES_REMOVED       server->client

Sent by the server to indicate that some resources are no longer available.

    {
        "type": "RESOURCES_REMOVED",
        "serial": number,           the serial of the relevant client message
        "ids": [
            IDs,
            .
            .
            .
        ]
    }

UPDATE_RESOURCE         client->server

The client wishes to make a change to a resource.

    {
        "type": "UPDATE_RESOURCE",
        "resource": { ...resource object... }
    }

The client should only send updated fields for mutable resource
fields. The server will follow up with an UPDATE_RESOURCES message
to confirm the changes.

REMOVE_RESOURCE         client->server

The client wishes to delete a resource.

    {
        "type": "REMOVE_RESOURCE",
        "id": ID
    }

The semantics of this message vary based on the resource type.
For a torrent, the torrent is deleted from the client. For a peer, the
peer will be removed. For a tracker, the tracker is removed from the torrent.
For other resources, there is no effect(this is subject to change).
On success, the client will be notified of the removal via a RESOURCES_REMOVED
message with the serial of the original message, in addition to any
updates from existing subscriptions.

                                SPECIAL MESSAGES

RPC_VERSION          server->client

The version of the RPC protocol being used by the synapse instance.
Minor version differences indicate non breaking changes, while major
version differences have no compatability guarantees. This message will
be sent to clients when they connect.

    {
        "type": "RPC_VERSION",
        "major": number,
        "minor": datetime,
    }

TRANSFER_OFFER          server->client

Indicates that the server will allow a file transfer over HTTP.
The path to use will be assumed to be known by the client, rather than given
by synapse. By default, synapse will listen for HTTP requests over its RPC port,
and if a websocket upgrade is not initiated, a transfer request is assumed.
The client should initiate an http request using bearer authorization.
This transfer must be initiated wihin the time limit defined by the expires field.
The client should send a POST request containing the binary encoded data.
The client should not attempt to resend this request, even if an error response
is later received. On failure, an error message is issued for the original
message's serial. Successful behavior is dependent on the type of transfer
occurring.

    {
        "type": "OPEN_TRANSFER",
        "serial": number,           message serial this is in response to
        "expires": datetime,
        "token": string,          bearer token that should be used to authorize the request
        "size": number,             bytes, expected size of transfer
    }

UPLOAD_TORRENT          client->server

Indicates that the client would like to upload a .torrent file to the server.
The server will respond with a TRANSFER_OFFER message. If successful the server
will add the torrent and the client will be notified via RESOURCES_EXTANT with
the serial set to the initial request's serial. Note that if the client is already subscribed
to torrent updates, it will receive the RESOURCES_EXTANT message twice.
The serial should be used to distinguish the two.

    {
        "type": "UPLOAD_TORRENT",
        "size": number,             bytes, size of .torrent file
        "path": string,             optional download path
        "start": boolean,           optional, if false torrent will start paused
    }

UPLOAD_MAGNET           client->server

Adds a torrent via its magnet link. If successful the server will add the
torrent and the client will be notified via RESOURCES_EXTANT with the serial set
to the initial request's serial.

    {
        "type": "UPLOAD_MAGNET",
        "uri": string,
        "path": string,             optional download path
        "start": boolean,           optional, if false torrent will start paused
    }

UPLOAD_FILES            client->server

Uploads a file or group of files to the server, presumably for seeding. The
server will issue a TRANSFER_OFFER and the client should upload a tarball.

    {
        "type": "UPLOAD_FILES",
        "size": number,             bytes, size of tarball
        "path": string              absolute or relative to download directory
    }

PAUSE_TORRENT          client->server

Pauses a torrent.

    {
        "type": "PAUSE_TORRENT",
        "id": ID
    }

RESUME_TORRENT          client->server

Resumes a torrent.

    {
        "type": "RESUME_TORRENT",
        "id": ID
    }

UPDATE_TRACKER          client->server

Updates a tracker.

    {
        "type": "UPDATE_TRACKER",
        "id": ID
    }


VALIDATE_RESOURCES      client->server

Validates a list of resources. At the moment only torrents will be
validated, however this may be expanded to includes files in the future.

    {
        "type": "VALIDATE_RESOURCES",
        "ids": [
            IDs,
            .
            .
            .
        ]
    }

                                 ERROR MESSAGES

All error messages share a common format and are only sent from server->client.

    {
        "type": *,
        "serial": number,           The serial of the offending message
        "reason": string,           User-friendly error message
    }

The various error types are:

UNKNOWN_RESOURCE: the client used a resource ID the server does not recognize
INVALID_RESOURCE: the client an inappropriate resource type for the operation
INVALID_MESSAGE: the client used an invalid message type
INVALID_SCHEMA: the schema of the message was invalid
INVALID_REQUEST: the message was logically invalid (i.e. string > number)
TRANSFER_FAILED: a transfer initiated by the client failed
PERMISSION_DENIED: the server does not allow this request (i.e. add torrents)
SERVER_ERROR: something went wrong on the server's side, client is not at fault

Note that error handling is not guaranteed to occur if any form of error is detected at
the transport (i.e. WebSocket) or encoding (i.e. JSON) level. Should errors occur
for either the client or server here, the connection may be immediately and uncleanly
closed.

                                 HTTP DETAILS
Synapse's RPC port services three types of HTTP requests: Upgrade, Transfer, and Download.
Upgrade is used for a websocket upgrade and only requires that a query parameter 'password'
be present if authentication is configured. Transfer is used for transfering files to synapse.
It only requires that HTTP bearer authorization be present in the request.
Download is a special request used to download files from synapse.
It requires that the HTTP path be of the form '/dl/:id?password=hackme',
password only being required if authentication is enabled for synapse.
